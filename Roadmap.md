# Coker Roadmap

## v0.3 - Dynamical Systems Tools

Goals:
 - Add representations for ODE/DAE's and Variational Optimisation problems (VOP)
 - Implement solver API for casadi/numpy/scipy
 - Implemented transcription of ODE/DAE/VOP to nonlinear program via pseudospectral methods
 - Tools for Monte-Carlo simulation of parameterised models.
